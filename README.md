# day1
This is the first day project of the "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021" on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/ <br>
I'm posting this here to keep track of my own progress. Nothing more, nothing less. <br>
The assignment was to create a band name generator using input, print, variables, etc. Nothing fancy to see here yet, because it's only day 1.
